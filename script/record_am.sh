# Real-time 433MHz FM/AM demodulation using rtl_fm
# - Sample rate: 170k (captures 85kHz bandwith: Nyquist 1/2 sample rate)
# - Most 433MHz devices use â‰¤50kHz BW (OOK/FSK modulation)
# - 170k provides buffer for drift/adjacent signals
# - Demodulates to audible frequencies (24kHz WAV)
# Usage: ./record_am.sh (Ctrl+C to stop)
# Process to audio offline. Remember to set a sample_rate that match the capture!
#  cat capture.iq | record_am.sh
#
# Output: timestamped .wav file with baseband audio
# Requires: rtl-sdr, sox
#
